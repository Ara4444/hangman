# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


##Milestone Files

 Each milestone python file has a portion of the code needed to make up the Hangman game, this way you can see how the game was created and allows them to understand the code
 as there are docstrings within each file explaining the context behind the code. Note, the file Milestone_5.py is where the code for the Hangman game is put together and is in its final form
 whereas the other files are used to do a portion of the code at a time making it neat and less confusing. 


 ##Getting Started
 
  In order to play the game, follow the steps below:
   1. Clone the Repo to your local machine
   2. Open the milestone_5.py file in a Python editor
   3. Modify the varaible word_list for words you want to include in the game (Optional)
   4. Finally run the script in your Python envorenment


##How to Play

 Once you have run the script, you will be asked to guess a letter, therefore you go ahead and enter a letter. After you have entered your letter the game will give you feedback on whether the 
 letter was correct or not or you have entered an invalid input.

 Note that you only have limited amount of lives(currently set to 5) to guess the word. If you use up the lives and have not guessed the word then you lose, if you guess th word before your lives
 run out then you win!


 ##Customization

  You can customize the variable "Word_list"(in milestone_5.py before running the game), either add,remove or create an entirely new list of words.

  Another variable you could change is the "num_lives" parameter(contained in milestone_4.py)when creating the "Hangman" instance.
